# Guessing Game
The Guessing Game is a Python project where the user and the computer compete to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The user makes guesses based on feedback, while the computer uses a binary search algorithm to find number efficiently. This project also includes error handling for user inputs and visualizes the computer's guesses during its search.

## Features
* **Random Number Generation**: the game generates a random number between 1 and 100
* **User Gameplay**:
    - the user enters guesses and receives feedback (higher, lower, or you guessed it)
    - displays each guess the computer makes to visualize the binary search process
* **Comparison**: At the end of the game, the program compares the number of guesses taken by the user and the computer
